/**
 * MA uses AJAX extensively to implement both an effective and simple user interface, and rapid and automatic page
 * updating for system monitoring. The long poll mechanism allows services in a page to request to be included in a
 * single long poll request, such that updates directed to any of the requested services will be returned. By coalescing
 * all services into a single request, MA prevents conditions where an arbitrary number of AJAX requests are being
 * made, potentially exceeding the maximum number of requests allowed by a single page. Long poll requests also utilize
 * resources better than polling, and also result in better response times.
