  The <b>URL</b> is the address of the image to be retrieved. Use the <img src="images/bullet_go.png"/> icon to test 
  the URL. (Opens in a new window or browser tab.) The <b>Timeout</b> and <b>Retry</b> fields determine how long to 
  wait for the web server to return the image, and how many times to retry the connection in the event of failures. If 
  all of the retries are exhausted, a data point exception event is raised.

  Images can be automatically scaled as required to save memory or file system space. (Images can be scaled up as well,
  but since this does not increase resolution it is usually not practical to do.) The "percent" scaling type is a 
  "relative" scaling method that results in an image that is scaled to the <b>Scale percentage</b> size of the original 
  image. The "box" scaling method is an "absolute" scaling method that scales the original image so that it fits into 
  the "box" defined by the given <b>Scale width</b> and <b>Scale height</b>.

  The read limit allows the setting of a maximum response size that may be received. If the size of the image data 
  exceeds the given value the data will be discarded and a data retrieval event will be raised.

  If the image source is a web cam, you may enter live feed code into the provided text area. This code will be entered
  verbatim into a new window or browser tab (surrounded by html and body tags). If the web cam live feed requires the 
  use of an ActiveX component or Java applet you will need to install such components appropriately within the Mango
  instance.
