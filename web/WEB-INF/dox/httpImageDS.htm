<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  This data source is used to collect images web sites available on the internet, or internal equipment available on an
  intranet. Using mechanisms similar to a web browser, the data source requests information from HTTP-enabled devices, 
  and then saves the images to a protected area of the file system. This is a polling data source.

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the HTTP request is made.
