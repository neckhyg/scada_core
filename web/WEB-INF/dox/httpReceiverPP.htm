  The <b>HTTP parameter name</b> is the key used to deliver data to the HTTP receiver data source. It is delivered as 
  the 'pointName' portion within point values formatted either as 'pointName=pointValue' or 
  '__pointFoo=pointName&amp;__valueFoo=pointValue'. You can use the HTTP receiver listener functionality in the HTTP 
  receiver data source configuration to determine what parameter names are available in your requests.
</p>
<p>The <b>Data type</b> is any valid data type. See the general system overview for more information on data types.</p>
<p>If the data type is Binary, a <b>Binary 0 value</b> must be provided. If the point value in the request matches this value, the value assigned to the point will be 0; it otherwise will be 1.</p>
