<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Publishers can be considered the opposite of data sources. Instead of gathering data into the system, publishers 
  distribute data out. This can be useful when using Mango to gather information from disparate systems in order to 
  modify, cleanse, or otherwise manage it, and then send it in a common format to other systems. In this way, Mango is 
  not only M2M, but M2M2M. Publishers can even be used to send data to other Mango instances, perhaps consolidating 
  data among various field instances into head-office management data. Indeed, instance of Mango can use publishers to 
  control each other in many ways.

<h1>Common publisher configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every publisher has a <b>Name</b> which is used to visually identify it in lists. It is recommended that each 
  publisher have a unique name, but is not required. The <b>Enabled</b> checkbox is used to enable or disabled the 
  publisher.
</p>
<p>
  Publishers use caches to ensure that every point update is delivered to its destination. If the destination for 
  whatever reason does not accept these deliveries for an extended period of time, this cache can become very large. 
  A <b>Cache warning size</b> can be defined which causes an alarm to be raised whenever this queue size is exceeded. 
  This alarm returns to normal when the cache is less that 90% of this warning size, or when the publisher is disabled.
  To prevent memory problems, publishers also define a <b>Cache discard size</b>. If the queue size is found to exceed
  this value entries will be discarded until the queue is again at an acceptable level. Entries in the queue are also
  discarded when the publisher is disabled.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Update event</b> value determines whether all point updates are delivered, or only point changes.
