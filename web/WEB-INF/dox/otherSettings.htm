  UI performance represents the responsiveness of the user interface. This includes all activities that are managed via
  the long poll mechanism, such as the maximum alarm level indicator, AJAX updating, event list updates, etc. If
  the Mango host has a limited-power CPU, you may want to set the UI performance to a lower level to prevent users 
  browsers from consuming too much of the hosts CPU.

  If "Send errors to Serotonin" is checked, exceptions that this instance of Mango observes will be sent to Serotonin 
  Software for review. If you are modifying the Mango source for your own purposes, please set this value to unchecked.

<p>
  Use the "purge point data" settings to determine the default purge settings for data point history data. These 
  settings may be overridden at the data source level, which may be further overridden at the point level.
</p>

<p>
  Use the "purge events" settings to set the maximum age of an event before it is purged from the database. Purging 
  permanently deletes the event as well as any user comments associated with it.
</p>

<p>
  Click the <b>Purge all data</b> button to permanently delete all point samples currently in the database. This can be
  useful for giving a Mango instance a "fresh start", especially if spurious data exists from configuration and set up
  activities. 
</p>

<p>
  User the "Discard point values future dated" settings to set the maximum amount of time into the future for which 
  data points will accept new values. Any values with timestamps that exceed this value will be discarded, and an error
  message will be written to the log.
