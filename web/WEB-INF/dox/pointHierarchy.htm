  The point hierarchy can be used to arrange the points in your system in meaningful ways. This hierarchy is displayed 
  on the watch list. Originally, all points are placed in the root of the hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
  To create a sub folder off of the root, click the <img src="images/folder_add.png"/> icon. The folder 
  can be renamed by selecting it, editing the <b>Name</b> field in the Folder details section, and clicking the 
  <img src="images/save.png"/> icon. To delete a folder, select it and click the <img src="images/delete.png"/> icon. 
  Deleting a folder causes all of its children&mdash;sub-folders or points&mdash;to be moved to the parent folder.
</p>

<p>
  To move points or folders into other folders, simply drag them.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> no changes to the point hierarchy&mdash;including folder name changes&mdash;are saved until the 
  <img src="images/save.png"/> icon in the "Point Hierarchy" section is clicked.
